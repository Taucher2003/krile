# Krile

Krile is a **tag bot**.
"But wait, those already exist in mass!" you might say now.
Yes, but Krile is different and I know that everyone says that, so **let me explain** why she is different.

## What makes Krile special

Krile aims to be different and takes a **different approach on tag management**.

### Git managed Tags

Which might sound complicated is actually very easy.
GitHub and GitLab are both websites which allow on **site creation, deletion and modification** of files.
You can [create a repository](repositories/create.md) there.
User can [create](tags/index.md), delete and modify tags via pull requests on a repository.
Krile will regularly fetch repositories and check for changes, of course you can also force the update.

### No tag ownership

Because the tags are public on a git service, there is **no owner of a tag**.
Usually tags get **outdated** and the one able to create them is **not there or busy**.
Now **everyone in the community can update the tag** and all it takes is press approve on the pull request.

### Share knowledge

Of course, you can not only [add](repositories/add.md) your **own repository**, but an **unlimited amount** of **other
tag repositories**.
This allows you to profit from other communities' knowledge.
Of course, they can also import your repository, and they profit from your community again.
It is a constant process of give and take

### Easy to use

Tags are [created](tags/index.md) in **markdown files**.
Each tag has its own file, which can be **easily edited**.
Tags also support **aliases** and **categories**, which can be directly set [inside the file](tags/meta.md) as well.

### Different tag formats

Krile does not only support normal **[Markdown tags](tags/markdown.md)**.
She has **[paginated tags](tags/paginated.md)**, allowing you to create tags which contain more than 2000 characters.
This will happen automatically if your tag gets to long, but surely you can set your own page markers.

Additionally, Krile supports **[embedded tags](tags/embed.md)**, allowing you to use embeds represented as json to post
a tag.

## The Name

Krile is named after a **Lalafel** from the **MMORPG Final Fantasy 14**, which has
a [free trial](https://freetrial.finalfantasyxiv.com/gb/) up to level 60 without any
limitation on game time.
But enough advertisement.
Krile is a scholar, who is **fond of a lot of knowledge**, and she usually always has something to share.
That's why I thought the name would be matching for this bot.
Krile is meant to **share knowledge** with others via public repositories and should ideally always have **some matching
information**.

# Tags

Tags are always markdown files ending with `.md`.
To create a new tag simply add a new markdown file to the repository directory.
A tag file consists of two different parts.

## Meta

The [meta](meta.md) is located at the top of the file.
It is optional, but allows some deeper configuration of a tag.

## Content

Krile has three different types of tags:

- [Markdown](markdown.md)
- [Paginated Markdown](paginated.md)
- [Embedded](embed.md)

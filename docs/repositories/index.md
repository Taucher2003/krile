# Repositories

Krile manages tags via **repositories**.
They can be **[created](create.md)** by anyone, communities, individuals, project groups.
Those repositories are hosted on a service like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
Users can then **[import](add.md)** those repositories in their server making the tags contained inside available to them.
Repositories are regularly checked for [updates](update.md), however you can also force the bot to check for an update.

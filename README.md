# Krile

Krile is a discord bot to manage public provided tags.
Those tags are provided by git repositories.

Servers can import the repositories they need and make the tags inside them available to their community.

You can either use the docker image or the [public instance](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1126568385732419615&scope=bot&permissions=274877959168) provided by me.

If you want to learn how to use the bot take a look at the [website](https://krile.chojo.dev/).
